title: Legal considerations of plain language
---

We write using plain language because we want to meet our readers’ needs; we also write using plain language because it’s the law.

In 2010, President Obama signed the [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf). We’ve included the link to the Act proper in case you’d like to read it, but the gist of it is this: Federal agencies have to create communications the public can understand and use.

Not long after the Plain Writing Act passed, President Obama issued an Executive Order ([EO 13563 — Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/18/executive-order-13563-improving-regulation-and-regulatory-review)) that requires regulations to be written in clean, easy-to-understand, accessible language.

The bottom line is this: Plain language isn’t just a stylistic choice — it’s the law. Creating clear, accessible content helps your users and upholds the Plain Writing Act and related legislation. Do right by your users and follow the law: Write using plain language.
