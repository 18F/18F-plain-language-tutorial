title: Why is plain language important?
---

We touched on this just a moment ago, but we’ll say it again: **Plain language is important because it makes information more accessible.** How does it do this? In several ways. 

First, by eliminating unnecessary material, plain-language content surfaces salient points (gets to the heart of things), allowing readers to get the information they need more quickly. 

Second, by using words and constructions that can be understood by broad audiences, plain-language content makes itself more easily read by everyone, which also contributes to its effectiveness.

As content creators for the federal government, we must always remain aware of our audience — the American public. We’re writing for everyone: Not only folks with a college or graduate education, not only folks who are comfortable navigating websites, not only readers with a great grasp of legalese: everyone. This means we must communicate in a way that all readers can understand and appreciate.

Some folks worry that plain language might put off readers with higher education levels; in fact, the opposite is true. All readers like saving time and expending only as much effort as they need to get the information they’re looking for. Plain-language content helps readers reach both of these goals.
