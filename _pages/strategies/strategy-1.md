title: "Strategy 1: Always think of your user"
---

This holds true for all projects you take on (and, when it comes down to it, all sub-disciplines of design): Before doing anything, think of your user. What are their needs? What information must they have? What information would they find extraneous? And what can you do to make their experience more pleasant and useful? 

Promoting plain language is often misunderstood as writing for an audience with a very low reading level. Plain-language content helps readers with low reading levels, but it also helps readers with more developed skills. This is because writing in plain language is about **recognizing your audience’s needs and crafting your content to meet them.**

It’s likely that the projects you work on are varied. In some cases, you’ll be writing for a broad audience whose members have dramatically varied educational levels. In this instance, you should write to a level that appeals to the largest percentage of your anticipated readers.

In other cases, though, you’ll be writing for a much more targeted audience, which will make it easier for you to determine the precise reading level you should aim for.

Regardless of the breadth of your readership, make your first goal to make your content accessible to all of your readers. 

For example, consider the following passage, originally drafted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for a weight-loss brochure: 

_The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends a half hour or more of moderate physical activity on most days, preferably every day. The activity can include brisk walking, calisthenics, home care, gardening, moderate sports exercise, and dancing._

Take a moment to consider how you might rewrite the above paragraph. What would you trim? Clarify?
Now check out the revised language:

_Do at least 30 minutes of exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week._

Wide audiences can easily understand the above sentence, which clearly addresses readers through an implied “you” subject. This transfers the focus of the sentence from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans to the user.
