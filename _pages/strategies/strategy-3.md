title: "Strategy 3: Keep it short and sweet"

Getting right to the point shows you respect your reader’s time — you aren’t requiring them to jump through metaphorical hoops to get the information they need. Make sure each sentence, and paragraph contains only the information it needs to.

If a sentence is becoming unwieldy, break it into two (or more) shorter sentences.

Ditto paragraphs: If you’re writing paragraphs of seven or eight sentences (or more!), break them into shorter ones.

In our HHS brochure, the authors eliminated a long list of proposed activities in favor of a single example — ”brisk walking” — to tighten language. 

When in doubt, put yourself in your reader’s shoes. What would you want to know right away? What information is less critical? Use these insights to inform the content you create.
