title: "Strategy 2: Use the simplest word that will do"
---

Careful word choice is central to plain-language writing. Use the clearest, most straightforward language you can without sacrificing accuracy. Readers of all levels will appreciate the effort you put into making your content succinct and understandable.

Let’s look again at our HHS brochure:

Old: _The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends a half hour or more of moderate physical activity on most days, preferably every day. The activity can include brisk walking, calisthenics, home care, gardening, moderate sports exercise, and dancing._

New: _Do at least 30 minutes of exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week._

Take note of how much simpler it is to read “30 minutes,” instead of “a half hour.” Additionally, telling readers to “do” exercise is more straightforward than saying guidelines “recommend” it.

A note on technical language and acronyms: When you can, avoid both. In some cases, you won’t be able to avoid using technical terms, acronyms, and other complex words. That’s OK — make sure you accompany them with plain-language definitions (explanations).
