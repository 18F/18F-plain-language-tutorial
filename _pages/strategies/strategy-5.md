title: "Strategy 5: Use visuals"

Great written content is made even better by the inclusion of well-crafted visuals. If your team includes visual designers (and your project budget has some flexibility), work with them to create images that reinforce — and expand on — the meaning of your written content. 

Even if you aren’t able to work with visual designers, you can still make your content more visually appealing. Break large chunks of text into smaller ones to guide the reader’s eye through the page. When appropriate, use bulleted lists — these make strings of items easier to read, and they provide a bit of visual relief. You may even (judiciously) use bolded terms to draw attention to important words and phrases. Just don’t go overboard — excessive bolding and use of italics can be distracting.
