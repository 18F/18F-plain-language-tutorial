title: "Strategy 4: Cut to the chase (also known as the inverted pyramid structure)"
---

We’ve touched on this already, but it bears repeating: Make sure your users can find the information they need as quickly as possible. 

We like to use the inverted pyramid structure often used in journalism. This structure has the author place a piece’s most important content first and present other information in descending importance. 

Compare the first words of our revised HHS brochure — “Do at least 30 minutes of exercise” — with the original version — “The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends.” Which more clearly communicates the central point of the article?

The revised sentence leads with the important information rather than an unwieldy introductory clause. Often, readers come to the government looking for clear guidance, and “do at least 30 minutes of exercise” is just that.

Another way to think about this is the “Mick Jagger rule.” Imagine you’re meeting a friend for coffee and run into Mick Jagger on the street. When your friend asks about your day, you’ll lead with “I just saw Mick Jagger!” You won’t start your story with, “I woke up this morning and had oatmeal for breakfast.”
