title: There’s more to learn (additional resources)
---

We’re glad you joined us for this lesson, and we hope you’ve found it helpful. We also know that what we’ve discussed is really the tip of the iceberg — there’s lots more to learn about plain language.

For that reason, we’ve compiled a list of resources you can use to continue your study. Here are some of our favorites: 

**[18F’s Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/index.html)**: Our in-house style guide, which we adopted from GOV.UK’s excellent work.

**[PLAIN](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/)**: The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN, for short) is a cross-agency group of federal employees who support plain language usage and clear communication. They’re industry leaders on plain-language writing, and we heartily encourage you to visit their site. 

**[DigitalGov’s Checklist](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/plain-language-web-writing-tips/)**: The team at DigitalGov.gov has created this handy checklist you can use to make sure your content is at peak readability.
