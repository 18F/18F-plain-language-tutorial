title: How can I tell if my content is in plain language?
---

You’ve researched plain language and you’ve written new content with your user in mind — now what? How can you be sure that what you’ve written is meeting your user’s needs and communicating what you want it to?

In an ideal situation, you’d be able to do user testing. PLAIN has some [great information](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/testing.cfm) about different types of user tests to assess content’s readability, and we encourage you to check out their Test section to learn more about them. 

In some cases, though, you might not have the option to do user testing. This is OK: There are other things you can do you assess your content’s readability. One strategy you can use is to run your content through a reading-level-assessment site — there are plenty of good ones out there. Lots of sites provide an aggregate reading level score, along with analogous scores using some of the more common rubrics (the Flesch Kincaid grade level, the Gunning Fog score, the Automated Readability Index, and others). In the absence of other design constraints, it’s a best practice to write for readers at an eighth-grade reading level. 

Another strategy you can use to determine the readability of your content is to read your writing aloud. This often used copy-editing technique forces you to slow down and engage with what you’ve put on the page. Even if you feel silly doing it, reading everything you’ve written aloud is one of the best ways to engage with language you’ve drafted.
