As with the first activity, take a few minutes to rewrite this statement. 

Below is a sample re-write of the FAQ above. Although this is the version that launched on the Every Kid in a Park site, we’d again like to stress that there’s no single, correct way to rewrite a piece of text. The revision you see below focused on eliminating the FAQ format — which [users find frustrating](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/faqs/) — and lowering the reading level to that of its users (10 year olds).
