**Activity 1: Privacy statement**

Here’s a privacy statement currently in use on some online forms — take a moment (or several) to read it:

>AUTHORITIES: The information requested on this application, and the associated evidence, is collected under the
Immigration and Nationality Act section 334 [8 U.S.C. 1445[SB1] ].
 
>PURPOSE: The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this application is to determine if you have established eligibility for naturalization. USCIS requests the applicant to provide their Social Security Number (SSN)
>to facilitate and expedite the adjudication of the applicant’s request. The SSN is used to establish and corroborate the applicant’s identity to complete a sufficient background check. DHS will use the information you provide to grant or deny the immigration benefit you are seeking.
 
>DISCLOSURE: The information you provide is voluntary. However, failure to provide the requested information, including the SSN, and any requested evidence, may delay a final decision in your case or result in denial of your application.
 
>ROUTINE USES:  DHS may share the information you provide on this application with other Federal, state, local, and foreign government agencies and authorized organizations. DHS follows approved routine uses described in the associated published system of records notices [DHS-USCIS-007 - Benefits Information System and DHS-USCIS-001
>- Alien File, Index, and National File Tracking System of Records] which you can find at [www.dhs.gov/privacy](http://www.dhs.gov/privacy). DHS may also share the information, as appropriate, for law enforcement purposes or in the interest of national security.

Now, take a few minutes to rewrite this statement (or parts of it), keeping in mind the strategies we’ve covered.

Before we share a few rewrites we like, we want to stress that there are no hard-and-fast “right” answers when it comes to writing in plain language. You know your audience (and their needs) best, and it’s up to you to find the language that communicates your intended message and resonates with your readership.

On that note, here are a few rewrites of the above passage that pass the plain-language text. Which of these, if any, would work best with your readers? Why?

**Option 1: We value your privacy**

>To complete this application, you have to provide personal information (including your Social Security Number). USCIS will **only** use the information you share to determine whether you’re eligible for U.S. citizenship.

>Sharing information with USCIS is entirely voluntary. However, if you don’t complete all portions of your application, your application may be processed more slowly or denied. 

>Please note that USCIS may share information from your application with other federal agencies. Learn more [here](http://www.dhs.gov/topic/privacy).

**Option 2: PURPOSE redux**

>The reason USCIS is asking for certain information, including your social security number, is to determine whether you’re eligible to apply for naturalization. 

>USCIS will use your social security number to verify your identity, conduct a background check, and process your request. 

>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will also use the information you share to approve or deny your application.
